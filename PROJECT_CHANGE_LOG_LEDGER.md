# PROJECT_CHANGE_LOG_LEDGER

## 2026-05-08

### Date/time

2026-05-08, Africa/Cairo timezone.

### Agent/model if known

Codex GPT-5 main agent with parallel GPT-5.5 extra-high-reasoning explorer subagents.

### Task summary

Implemented the initial full-stack `youtube-discovery` platform scaffold as a professional Next.js 16 SaaS application for official YouTube public metadata discovery. The implementation includes app shell, required route map, search workspace, local filters, manifests, server-side YouTube adapters, scoped Gemini routes, Prisma 7 schema/migration, env guardrails, README, CI, and ledgers.

### Reason/root cause

The repository was a fresh `create-next-app` scaffold. The two ledgers were empty, `.env.example` was missing, no product routes existed beyond `/`, no API layer existed, no Prisma/Supabase persistence existed, no Gemini/AI layer existed, and the current UI did not implement the guide.

### Technical details

- Added dependency set for Zod, lucide-react, Framer Motion, FlexSearch, Zustand, TanStack Query, Google GenAI, Prisma 7, PostgreSQL adapter, `pg`, `@next/env`, and `server-only`.
- Added env validation scripts that load root `.env.local`, warn about unsupported `.local.env`/`src/.local.env`, and avoid printing secret values.
- Added Prisma 7 config with validation-only placeholder URL for schema validation/generation and guarded migration apply script.
- Added canonical Prisma schema and migration for YouTube videos, channels, playlists, sources, manifests, manifest items, saved videos, collections, AI sessions, search/fetch jobs, page attempts, provider logs, and quota events.
- Added server-only YouTube client and services for `search.list`, `videos.list`, `channels.list`, `playlists.list`, and `playlistItems.list`.
- Added URL analyzer for video, Shorts, watch+list, channel, handle, playlist, and search URL shapes.
- Added manifest builder and runtime in-memory manifest store for temporary/saved manifests until database repositories are enabled.
- Added zero-safe local result filtering and sorting that preserves `0` numeric metadata.
- Added Gemini assistant routes with explicit scopes, capped manifest context, response validation, evidence refs, limitations, and missing-key fallback.
- Replaced starter UI with centralized design tokens, responsive shell, dashboard, search workspace, result cards, manifest summary, AI panel, and required page scaffolds.

### Architecture impact

The app now follows the guide's manifest-first architecture. Provider settings, temporary manifests, local filters/search-inside-results, AI scopes, and persistence schema are separated. Backend authority remains in route handlers and server-only library modules.

### Environment impact

Added `.env.example`, root `.env.local` guidance, build env preflight, Prisma validation scripts, and `.gitignore` exception for `.env.example`. No secrets were printed.

### Database/migration impact

Created initial Prisma schema and one initial migration. No migration was applied. `db:apply` was not run.

### YouTube API/quota impact

Added official YouTube Data API server adapters and quota estimates. No live YouTube calls were verified because live verification depends on `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`.

### AI scope/safety impact

Added server-only Gemini route helpers with explicit AI scopes and no-invention contract. Missing Gemini key produces an honest unavailable response. AI suggestions require user confirmation.

### Verification run and results

- `npm run db:validate`: passed after adding the missing Prisma relation opposite field.
- `npm run lint`: passed after removing unused imports and fixing React Compiler lint issue.
- `npx tsc --noEmit --incremental false`: passed after fixing JSX escaping and strict state types.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed and generated Prisma Client 7.8.0.
- `npm run build`: passed with Next.js 16.2.6 Turbopack production build.
- Dev server started at `http://localhost:3000`.
- HTTP smoke checks returned 200 for `/`, `/search`, `/link-explorer`, `/settings`, `/ai-search`, `/channels`, `/channel-explorer`, `/playlists`, `/playlist-explorer`, `/manifests`, `/collections`, `/saved`, and `/history`.
- `/search` smoke content confirmed `Provider search settings`, `0 views`, and the local pipeline text.
- `POST /api/youtube/link/analyze` with a watch URL plus playlist returned a video strategy using `videos.list` after user confirmation.
- `POST /api/ai/youtube-manifest-assistant` returned a safe schema-validation rejection response when the model output did not match the scoped JSON contract.
- `npm audit fix`: no non-breaking fix available; remaining moderate advisories require `--force` with breaking package changes.

### Blocked checks, if any

Live YouTube provider verification was not run because `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` availability was not assumed or printed. The AI route smoke test did not produce a useful Gemini analysis; it verified the safe response-validation path. `npm run db:status` reached a configured PostgreSQL endpoint but failed with a Prisma schema engine error, so remote migration status was not verified. Database migration apply against Supabase was not run.

### Remaining risks/limitations

- Runtime manifest store is non-durable until Prisma migrations are applied and repository persistence is enabled.
- Auth/owner identity is not implemented; `ownerId` is a schema placeholder for future owner scope.
- Saved library, collections, history, channel detail, playlist detail, and manifest detail pages are shell scaffolds.
- Browser smoke verification was limited to HTTP/content checks rather than screenshot tooling.
- `npm audit` reports moderate transitive advisories in Prisma/Next dependency trees, and the current npm suggestion requires breaking forced changes.

### Whether secrets were printed

No.

### Whether migrations were created/applied

One migration was created. No migration was applied.

### Whether `db:apply` was run

No.
